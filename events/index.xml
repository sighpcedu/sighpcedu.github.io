GenAI tools offer new pathways for education and user support, from training new users &amp;amp; developing support materials to debugging code and optimizing performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join the ACM SIG-HPC Education Chapter for this virtual event to discuss practical applications and early lessons from centers already experimenting with these new tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event will feature two presentations from HPC centers that have begun implementing GenAI solutions. Following the presentations, we will host a discussion for participants to share their own experiences, challenges, and ideas for the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twelfth SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education (BPHTE25) at 9:00 AM CST on Mon, Nov 11, 2025</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte25/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 08:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte25/</guid><description>Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training workshop series at SC has provided a global forum for addressing common challenges and solutions for enhancing HPC training and education, for sharing information through large and small group discussions, and for fostering collaboration opportunities. The Twelfth workshop (BPHTE25), an &lt;a href="https://sighpceducation.acm.org">ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter&lt;/a> coordinated effort, is a full day workshop focusing on extending collaborations among practitioners from traditional and emerging fields, exploring the challenges in developing and deploying HPC training and education, and identifying new challenges and opportunities for the latest HPC platforms. The workshop will provide opportunities for: disseminating results, understanding the recent challenges with effectiveness of HPC education and training materials and promoting collaborations among HPC educators, trainers and users.</description></item><item><title>Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education at 9:00 AM EDT on Sun, Mar 3, 2026</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award26/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter is announcing an upcoming call for nominations for the 2026 education award to recognize outstanding contributions to computational, data-enabled science, and HPC education and training in all disciplines.&lt;/p>
