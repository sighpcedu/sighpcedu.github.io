GenAI tools offer new pathways for education and user support, from training new users &amp;amp; developing support materials to debugging code and optimizing performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join the ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter for this virtual event to discuss practical applications and early lessons from centers already experimenting with these new tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This event featured two presentations from HPC centers that have begun implementing GenAI solutions. Following the presentations, we hosted a discussion for participants to share their own experiences, challenges, and ideas for the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education at 9:00 AM EDT on Sun, Mar 3, 2026</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award26/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter is announcing an upcoming call for nominations for the 2026 education award to recognize outstanding contributions to computational, data-enabled science, and HPC education and training in all disciplines.&lt;/p>
