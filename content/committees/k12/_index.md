# K-12 Committee

## Committee Description

The purpose of the SIGHPC Education K-12 Committee is to support educators introducing HPC & Data Science concepts in K-12 settings by:

1. Building community and connecting people working in this space
2. Identifying and promoting useful teaching resources and activities, aligned with the discipline standards, including Math & Science (and relevant standards from other countries.
3. Supporting professional development for both in-service and pre-service teachers, particularly in the Computational Thinking and Parallel Thinking spaces
4. Identifying gaps in the existing resources and supporting the development of new resources to fill those gaps.
5. Identifying funding and resource opportunities to support these activities

##  Committee Goals

1. In coordination with the education content committee, develop pathways in Data Science and HPC education at the K-12 level to best prepare students to advance their undergraduate studies.
2. Build career identification resources for K-12 to demonstrate the application of these skills
3. Identify resources directly relevant to the K-12 (pre-college) charter, which may then be proposed for addition to the repository of resources for K-12 education in HPC and Data Science.
Support and advocate for pre-service teacher training in Computational and Data Science.
4. Seek partnerships with appropriate teacher professional associations around the world.
