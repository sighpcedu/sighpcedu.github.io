Please join us for a webinar by Alasdair Wilson, University of Oxford on Gutenberg: An open-source research and teaching platform February 9 at 10 AM Eastern time 3 PM GMT. 

Gutenberg is an interactive training platform developed by OxRSE for delivering training in software engineering and research computing related topics to researchers, students and other RSEs. It is built with a modern web stack, featuring a dynamic Next.js frontend and a robust API-driven backend on top of a SQL database. Gutenberg is open-sourced and permissively licensed, making it easy to adapt, extend, and deploy. 

We shall present an overview of how Gutenberg works, how it is used by students to learn, how you can use the extensive library of existing training material, how you can create your own training material as well as how you can get running with your own deployment in order to begin organising training events.
