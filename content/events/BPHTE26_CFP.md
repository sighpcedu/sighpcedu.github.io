Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training workshop series at SC has provided a global forum for addressing common challenges and solutions for enhancing HPC training and education, for sharing information through large and small group discussions, and for fostering collaboration opportunities. The Thirteenth workshop (BPHTE26), an [ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://sighpceducation.acm.org__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!rCnZIZNL1ZM0vsDqULsIMUjncqtQvfWPAmK-5q7pzZKxT9ysnnhSu5QeTKMWeUPG2Jzb1oULer1RFbBfhcP1-oU$) coordinated effort, is a full day workshop focusing on extending collaborations among practitioners from traditional and emerging fields, exploring the challenges in developing and deploying HPC training and education, and identifying new challenges and opportunities for the latest HPC platforms. 

The workshop will provide opportunities for: disseminating results, understanding the recent challenges with effectiveness of HPC education and training materials and promoting collaborations among HPC educators, trainers and users. We are planning for papers, lightning talks and demos to be presented by members of the international community. *The workshop papers, extended lightning talks and demo abstracts will be published in a special issue of [Journal of Computational Science Education](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://jocse.org/__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!rCnZIZNL1ZM0vsDqULsIMUjncqtQvfWPAmK-5q7pzZKxT9ysnnhSu5QeTKMWeUPG2Jzb1oULer1RFbBf1Mq2g_c$)*.

*We are now inviting abstract submissions for papers, lightning talks and demos.*

**Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:**

* Scalable and sustainable approaches for HPC training or HPC education

*The workshop papers, extended lightning talks and demo abstracts will be published in a special issue of [Journal of Computational Science Education](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://jocse.org/__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!rCnZIZNL1ZM0vsDqULsIMUjncqtQvfWPAmK-5q7pzZKxT9ysnnhSu5QeTKMWeUPG2Jzb1oULer1RFbBf1Mq2g_c$)*

For full consideration for publication, each paper and extended abstract should describe:

* The nature of the training or education program
* Strategy
* Assessment or evaluation technique
* Situations for which it is relevant or in which it was applied
* An evaluation of its success
* Lessons learned
* Reproducibility of the processes and resources
* Relevance to the broad range of training or education topics associated with the workshop

**Abstract Submission (due August 12, 2026)**

The first stage of a three-stage submission process for the workshop. The first step is to submit a two-page extended abstract for your paper, lightning talk or demonstration submission. Upon submission of this abstract, a link will appear on your "My Submissions" page for you to upload your additional extended abstract (max 2 pages). Incomplete submissions (i.e., ones that do not include a file upload) will not be reviewed. Please view sample submission [here.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=SampleForm&id=SCWorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationAbstract&site=sc26__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!rCnZIZNL1ZM0vsDqULsIMUjncqtQvfWPAmK-5q7pzZKxT9ysnnhSu5QeTKMWeUPG2Jzb1oULer1RFbBfAGBHFjE$)

**Final Paper Submission (due September 9, 2026)**

Upon acceptance of your abstract, the second stage of the two-stage submission process is to submit a full paper, updated abstract or demo files depending on your submission type, to the online submission system. Please view sample submission [here.](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=SampleForm&id=SCWorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationFinalSubmission&site=sc26__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!rCnZIZNL1ZM0vsDqULsIMUjncqtQvfWPAmK-5q7pzZKxT9ysnnhSu5QeTKMWeUPG2Jzb1oULer1RFbBf-Jk3T6M$)
