Generative AI (GenAI) is already changing how we interact with complex systems, and High-Performance Computing is no exception. GenAI tools offer new pathways for education and user support, from training new users & developing support materials to debugging code and optimizing performance.

Join the ACM SIG-HPC Education Chapter for this virtual event to discuss practical applications and early lessons from centers already experimenting with these new tools.

This event will feature two presentations from HPC centers that have begun implementing GenAI solutions. Following the presentations, we will host a discussion for participants to share their own experiences, challenges, and ideas for the future.

## Who Should Attend?

This event is designed for:
- HPC educators and trainers
- User support and technical staff at HPC centers
- Computational scientists and researchers interested in GenAI applications
- Anyone involved in developing HPC curricula or support documentation
