The chapter depends on volunteers to carry out our mission. This work is done primarily through our standing committees.  Volunteers can participate in several ways:

* Undertake a short-term project or assignment that contributes to the work of a committee
* Join a committee and participate fully in its operations and decisions

Each committee is described in the committees section of the website. Included is a summary of the current activities and opportunities for volunteers to take on specific projects.

Look these over and then contact the chair to discuss your possible participation in the committee activities.
